# Real-Time Face Detection and Attendance Marking

This project is aimed at detecting faces in real-time video streams and marking attendance in an Excel file stored on Google Drive. It utilizes Google Colab, Haar Cascade, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms for achieving the desired functionality.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection:** Utilizes Haar Cascade for real-time face detection in video streams.
- **Attendance Marking:** Marks attendance of detected faces in an Excel file stored on Google Drive.
- **Google Colab Integration:** Developed and tested in Google Colab, providing an accessible and collaborative environment for development.
- **CNN Algorithm:** Incorporates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate face detection.

## Dependencies

- **OpenCV:** Open Source Computer Vision Library for real-time computer vision.
- **Google Colab:** Cloud-based Python notebook environment provided by Google.
- **Haar Cascade:** Pre-trained XML classifiers for detecting objects, including faces.
- **Google Drive API:** For accessing and modifying files stored on Google Drive.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Ensure you have a Google account and access to Google Drive.
4. Set up a Google Colab notebook environment.
5. Run the provided notebook files for face detection and attendance marking.

## Usage

1. Open the Google Colab notebook for face detection.
2. Upload the video stream or provide access to your webcam.
3. Run the notebook cells to initiate face detection.
4. Follow the prompts to mark attendance in the Excel file.
